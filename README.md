~~Attempt two at getting GitKracken to work properly.~~
I have given up on GitKracken, doesn't suit my needs, GitHubs own linux app works well for me.

~~Nothing in this repo yet, probably end up being random chunks of code or schematics.~~

Have added a file regards formatting in markdown. It's nothing that isn't already out there but I am using it to practice using markdown.
